Subject: [RFC 0/2] ABI: IIO: proposal for AVERAGING_RATIO support

This is an attempt to document/define simple downsampling/averaging
features for some ADC devices.

As discussed in https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/11/16/566

As an illustration, Patch 2 is an instance of implementation
using ina226.

Marc Titinger (2):
  ABI: iio: support AVERAGING_RATIO setting
  iio: ina2xx: convert AVERGING ratio setting from generic sysfs attr to
    ABI
